# Leads
## About
This is an employee tracker app that allows to add new employees to the system, update and delete them. For this project I've been using Ruby on Rails framework and Ember.js.

## Setup
Clone this repository or download the .zip. In Terminal open up the folder leads and run $ rails server. Then go to your browser and go to this link http://0.0.0.0:3000/.
